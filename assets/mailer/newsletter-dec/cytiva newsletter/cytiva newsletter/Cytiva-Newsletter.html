	  <p> We erroneously believe that harassment is always sexual. Harassment can be of any kind - mental, physical, visual, verbal, or written. This is my story of being mentally and emotionally harassed at the workplace and how I reported it.</p> 
	  <p> In my role as a consultant, I was reporting to two senior leaders,
who had been with the organization for 20 years. Soon after, one of them started placing unprofessional demands like purchase. of out-of-contract and high-end water bottles for personal use. conversion of personal room rates to corporate rates during family vacation, and other personal demands, to name a few instances. Often, I was compelled to behave unprofessionally
towards internal and external stakeholders. I was berated for
being incapable if I refused to fulfill non-compliant demands,</p>

	  <p> It had a huge impact on my mental health, confidence, and self-esteem, which reflected in my professional and personal life. As I was new to the organization, I felt incompetent to deal with the senior and hesitant to report to my reporting manager.</p> 
	  <p> I dealt with this ordeal for over 7 months before I gathered the courage to address it with the
HR manager. Yet I felt hesitant to report the incidents in fear of retaliation and humiliation.</p> 
	  <p> The Danaher Code of Conduct underlines our commitment to Diversity and Inclusion and
		workplace free of harassment.,</p>
		<p> A week later, I formally reported the unprofessional incidents to the HR manager, who then
reported the same to the AVP-HR. A meeting was scheduled with the offender.</p>
<p>The AVP -HR personally expressed regret for what I had to go through and gratitude for
bringing the incidents to light. For the first time I felt safe, valued, and respected, and my
journey has continued in the same spirit for the past 5 years. Subsequent requests from the
senior have been professional and in line with the JD.</p>
<p>At the outset, had I had the courage to directly confront the senior about the inappropriate.
behavior or report to the manager, this ordeal would have been quickly over. I have since learned not to tolerate any kind of harassment and bullying, and encourage my colleagues
(of any gender) to voice their concerns of similar manner.</p>
<p>Whether you are an employee or a consultant, whether the harassment occurs at the
workplace or at a customer location, please know that our internal committee is here to listen
to and support in every way possible with the sole purpose of making this company a healthy
and safe place.</p>
